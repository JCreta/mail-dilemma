    <div class="subhead">"Some Moron Marked It As 'Delivery Attempted'—Oh, I’ll Attempt Something, Alright," Says Area Woman</div>
    <div class="byline">By Staff Writer | February 18, 2025</div>

    <p>CHARLOTTE, NC—The United States Postal Service has *officially* messed with the *wrong woman*.</p>

    <p>Gina 71, a former *steelworker* turned *remote beverage industry operative*, is preparing to *unleash holy hell* on the local USPS branch after they botched yet another package delivery. The offense? Claiming they *attempted* delivery while she was sitting in her house, *watching them not do that exact thing*.</p>

    <div class="quote">“These absolute <span class="important">mental midgets</span> couldn’t deliver a package if their lives depended on it,” Gina raged, clutching her tracking receipt with the intensity of a woman about to represent herself in court. “They had the *gall* to mark my package as ‘Delivery Attempted – No Answer.’ OH REALLY? You’re telling me that while I was sitting *right here*, drinking my Diet Coke, my *Ring camera* and my two *hyper-vigilant guard dogs* just *happened* to miss you? What a convenient little fairytale.”</div>

    <p>Sources close to Gina (her dogs, Tosi and Lalo) confirmed that there was, in fact, no attempted delivery—only a USPS worker, presumably sitting in their truck, carefully selecting the “pretend we tried” button.</p>

    <p>Raised in the *Tri-State area*, Gina has never been one to tolerate *stupidity*, a fact made abundantly clear in her growing *handwritten grievance list* dating back to 2004. As a former steelworker, she insists that the basic concept of “doing your job” should not be *this difficult*.</p>

    <div class="quote">“I lifted *actual steel beams* in a factory for years, sweetheart. If I did my job like these postal rejects do theirs, entire *bridges* would collapse. These people can’t even put a box on my porch without turning it into a <span class="important">federal mystery.</span>”</div>

    <p>Now, Gina is taking action. *Decisive action*.</p>

    <div class="action">"I AM GOING DOWN THERE," SHE ANNOUNCED, CRACKING HER KNUCKLES.</div>

    <p>Despite being a Charlotte resident for over two decades, Gina’s *New York instincts* remain finely honed. She is prepared to invoke them in full force at the post office.</p>

    <p>“I don’t care how long I’ve been in North Carolina—I’m going *full New York* on these people,” she promised. “I will *raise such a scene*, the Postmaster General himself will feel a *disturbance in the force*.”</p>

    <p>At press time, Gina was reportedly seen muttering "Mail delivered huh, blow it out your ass".</p>
