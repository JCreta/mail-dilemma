    <h1>Local Woman, Former Steelworker, About to “Go Full New York” on USPS After Yet Another Lost Package</h1>
    <h2>CHARLOTTE, NC – USPS Has Officially Moved to the Top of Gina Thompson's "Problems to Solve" List</h2>

    <p>Seventy-one-year-old Gina Thompson has spent a lifetime working hard, first in the steel mills and now from the comfort of her home, where she logs hours for a national beverage company. But no amount of grit, determination, or old-fashioned elbow grease can protect her from the *absolute clown show* that is the United States Postal Service.</p>

    <p>“Back in <span class="highlight">*my day*</span>, people actually gave a damn about their jobs,” Gina fumed, gripping a crumpled tracking receipt like it was <span class="highlight">evidence in a federal RICO case</span>. “You think I could’ve just *forgotten* to weld a beam and told my boss, ‘Oopsie, I *attempted* to put it there’? No, I’d have been tossed into the furnace.”</p>

    <p>Gina, a proud product of the <span class="bold">*Tri-State area*</span>, has never been one to take incompetence lightly. Raised in a world where “if you didn’t hustle, you didn’t eat,” she has zero patience for what she calls “the USPS participation trophy brigade.”</p>

    <p>“They expect me to believe they knocked, rang, and just <span class="highlight">*coincidentally*</span> I didn’t hear them? Yeah, okay, genius,” she scoffed. “I *work from home*. I was sitting *right here*, processing invoices, drinking my Diet Coke, and listening to my <span class="bold">dogs</span> lose their damn minds over a squirrel 50 feet away. You think I wouldn’t hear some government lackey fumbling around my porch? My *Ring camera* says otherwise, bucko.”</p>

    <p>But it’s not just the lying that has Gina steaming—it’s the sheer *stupidity*.</p>

    <p>“I worked in a *steel mill*, sweetheart. I lifted things that would make these little mailroom Mickeys cry for their mommy. And yet, somehow, I still managed to *do my job correctly*. These people can’t even put a box on a porch without turning it into an unsolved mystery. I swear, it’s like dealing with a bunch of <span class="highlight">*mental midgets*</span>.”</p>

    <p>Now, Gina is ready to handle things the way she was taught: with a <span class="bold">direct approach</span> and <span class="bold">absolutely no regard for anyone’s feelings</span>.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I’m *going down there*,” she declared, cracking her knuckles like a mob enforcer about to collect a debt. “And I’m bringing *Tri-State energy* with me. I may live in North Carolina, but don’t get it twisted—I will go *full New York* on their asses. I don’t care if I have to burn my entire afternoon standing at that counter, glaring at some clueless government lifer who thinks ‘customer service’ means *breathing in my direction*—I *will* get my damn package.”</p>

    <p>She took a deep breath, adjusting her <span class="highlight">‘Don’t Tread on Me’ coffee mug</span>.</p>

    <p>“I’m gonna make *such a scene*, they’ll be naming a postal reform bill after me.”</p>

    <p>As of press time, Gina had already started compiling <span class="bold">a list of grievances</span> dating back to the Bush administration and had printed out USPS’s official policies, which she intended to *slam* onto the counter for dramatic effect.</p>

    <p class="signature">The postal carrier assigned to Gina’s route has reportedly filed for witness protection.</p>
